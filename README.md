A discord theme based on [Ccrashtek's comfy pink color scheme](https://github.com/ccrashtek/Comfy-theme-pink) and [Lode's](https://github.com/Leeprky/Lode) [CTP preset.](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/95e47b06620c7db940af55ac07bae5fba226b867b340fef6d46e83c96ec3cdbb/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f395851646470442e706e67) This theme only works on BetterDiscord since I make all my themes on BetterDiscord and that's the client mod I prefer, oh and it also works on dark mode not light mode because it sucks but I may make it universal when I'm in the mood.
